# Lab Binary Search Tree

Implemented class for creating a Binary Search Tree. This type of tree has two nodes, left and right, where nodes contain an integer value. 
This tree has the characteristic that all nodes to the right of a node have a value greater than this node, and all nodes to the left of this node
are less than the value of the node. This class also has methods for inserting a Node, for getting an array of integers and transforming them to 
a Binary Search Tree, and for getting the depth of a specific value and the height of the Tree.
