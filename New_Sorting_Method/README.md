# Lab New Sorting Algorithm
Implemented combination of Merge Sort and Quick Sort for a new sorting method.

First you start by dividing the array in halves, something similar to what Merge Sort does, then you apply Quick Sort to those halves.
You get two sorted arrays of the original values. Then like with Merge Sort you merge these two arrays into a single array which will be
all sorted.
