Lab 4 for CS2 class.

Implemented a Sort of Sorted class to sort of sort an array. What does that mean? Have the largest two elements at the end of the array (like it should be in a sorted array), then the next two largest elements at the beginning of the array. The next two largest numbers will be before the two biggest elements inserted previously and then the other two next largest elements should be placed after the first two elements placed at the beginnings. This will go on and on giving us a sort of sorted array. Better time complexity but it's not fully sorted.
