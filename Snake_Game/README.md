Lab4 for CS2 class. 
Finished implementation for SnakeGame. Created SnakeGame class which is used to
calculate the final score of the game. How do you calculate the final score?
This will be done in two ways, either by searching exhaustively or recursively.
You start with the head of the Snake and continue until you find the tail 
of the Snake, calculating the length of the Snake, which will be equal to 
the final score of the game.
